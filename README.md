# Project 3: Weather Mood Writer By Daniel Magarino, Tenzin Choedhen, and Anderson Perez

# SETUP:

# For this project our group had to make a call to a public API known as OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve weather data (temperature, weather description, and location) from a specified city given an API key from the website
# Next, we used a generative AI named Ollama to use user input as a prompt to create customized output in the form of a poem, journal entry, or short story based on the weather data pulled from the API as well as user inputs like what content the wants to see as well as the city the user inputs
# Then, we used the Gradio app to build the web-app's user interface such as the buttons, text, placeholder values, inputs accepted, and overall style of the app website
# Finally, we used Github to add on to each other's code and used one other branch aside from main branch to work on the app for version control (changed from feature_test_app branch to feature-initial branch)

# INSTRUCTIONS:

# 1. When working with this app first enter a city that you would like to see the weather of
# 2. Afterwards, choose the writing style (poem, short story, or journal entry) from the dropdown menu that you would like the generative AI to use
# 3. Lastly, click the generate button to generate the writing style selected from step 2 about the weather of the city provided in step 1

# Click the provided link to run the application
